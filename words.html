        <!-- ✏️ REPLACE BELOW WITH YOUR LYRICS -->

        <p>
Tell me you love me
Tell me you care
Tell me I'll never be alone
Never be alone again

I know you're weary
From the load that you bear
I promise I'll always be around 
Always be around to share

So let's tattoo these rings with our words 
So they'll last well beyond the day that we die
Some say it won't last
but my darling I'm willing to try

Say that you're with me
Say that you're here
Say that you’ll always hold me close 
Always hold me close and near

I’m here beside you
Through the bad and the good
I promise I’ll dedicate my life
Dedicate it like I should

So let's tattoo these rings with our words 
So they'll last well beyond the day that we die
Some say it won't last
but my darling I'm willing to try   

And now ain't the time for saving
Let’s  do so much more than survive
Let’s take on the world we’re braving
And make the best days of our lives

So tell me you want me
Every night, every day
I promise my heart will never fade
My heart will never fade away

So let's tattoo these rings with our words 
So they'll last well beyond the day that we die
Some say it won't last
but my darling I'm willing to try  

I am willing to try
Are you willing to try
Are you willing to try
Yes, I am willing to try
